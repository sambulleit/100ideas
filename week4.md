Well, I'd say one key tech item that took off after the end of this book was the smart watch. Wearable tech had been an idea we'd been playing around with since the late 20th century, but nothing resembling the modern smart watch existed until the Pebble watch which launched on kickstarter in 2012. Past that, many of us might not even know what a Pebble is. The first smart watch many of us would recognize is the Apple Watch, which wasn't announced until 2014.

Autonomobiles are also a technology that went from essentially zero to something people actually own and use now. The first time I heard about self-driving cars, it was in Google's autonomobile back in 2009 that was going to be designed for elderly and disabled people to help them get around better. Little did I know, ten years later a self-driving BMW would be shuttling me around Las Vegas for my 21st birthday. The tech has been picked up by BMW, Audi, (soon) Ford, and wouldn't have gone nearly as far if it wasn't for the pioneering engineers over at Tesla who have been including it as a feature in their vehicles since 2013.

5G data is still technically something that doesn't really exist yet for the normal person, but we're so close. Last year, Chicago was among the first cities to roll out 5G in CDMA bands (Verizon and Sprint), but that is quickly going to expand. 5G data speed isn't like 4G, LTE, or 3G. It's going to change everything. Mobile data will reach a point where it can be so quick that there will no longer be any need for our current cable internet system. A movie can be downloaded in seconds, the infrastructure for autonomobiles will finally be in place, we will communicate exclusively through easily manageable towers rather than needing these undersea cables. The world will become more wireless and more connected than we've ever been before. The greatest challenge we currently face is how to get the signal to travel further. Current towers can't travel more than a mile or so, which makes 5G coverage for those of us who don't live in a city metro with a population of 9 million still a bit of a dream.
