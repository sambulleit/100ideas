1. To me at least, BBS sounds like it laid the foundation for internet forums. It actually sounds a lot like a proto-imageboard chan website like 8chan, Endchan, or the infamous 4chan. BBS started as a place for a widespread group on individuals to get together and learn about and discuss a common interest, with an underlying culture for the board one might be visiting. The imageboard sites can be pretty seedy places, but unlike many internet forums there's more of a sense of community there that I thought of when reading about BBS.

The xkcd subreddit:
Xkcd was and is a very, very famous webcomic that's been running at least as long as the observable universe, maybe longer. They have a very dedicated fanbase that used to keep the original GeoCities page archived and accessible. It's an important piece of internet culture, and it's sad to see that I can no longer find a link that's hosting the original GeoCities page.

Internet Archive:
Internet Archive is an online nonprofit digital library that does an exellent job of cataloguing the archived GeoCities pages.

GeoCities:
GeoCities, or rather GeoCities.ws, still exists as a domain hosting service. They actually have a search engine for old GeoCities pages and if you can go through their process to prove ownership you can actually edit it. Kinda cool if you ask me.


(Also fun fact: I found a torrent for the entire library of every archived GeoCities page... it's 652 GB if you're interested)
