1. A 'flame war' refers to when a conversation within an online forum thread or comment section gets derailed by arguments, eventually losing all relation to the OP. Within the context of emoticons, a flame war will ensue whenever the expression is misinterpreted by third parties in the thread/comments. 


2. An emoticon is a much earlier form of expressing emotion visually in online text than the emoji.

Ex. :-) , ;-) , :-(

An emoji is a later, more complex way of expressing emotion first made by Japanese internet users. The format's key characterization is in that one does not need to tilt their head in order to see the face that the icon is depicting

Ex. ^-^ , uwu , @_@

Though the format has later evolved into more graphic depictions of emotion than text.

Ex. ðŸ˜‚ , ðŸ˜Ž , ðŸ¤ 


3. When a JPEG is referred to as a lossy format, it means that the file is progressively degenerative as it's compressed and shared. The JPEG is a poor way to archive an image, though it's ideal for web-use. Other file formats such as GIF, TIFF, or even PNG do better as a lossless format, with the TIFF being ideal for archival purposes.


4. Metadata is the information about a file carried beneath the surface so to speak. As a photographer, Metadata is hugely important for me. When photos are captured on my camera and exported to my computer, the RAW files already carry information about the date the image was captured, the camera and lens it was captured with, and all of the exposure settings used to capture the image. It's hugely important when categorizing and organizing photos within my Lightroom library.
